# Breast Cancer Prediction: A Machine Learning Approach

## Overview
In this project, the aim is to predict breast cancer types (malignant or benign) using machine learning techniques. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, comprises 569 instances with 31 features, including physical characteristics of tumors.

## Dataset Information
The dataset contains information on physical characteristics of tumors. It consists of 569 instances with 31 features, and the target variable is the type of breast cancer (malignant or benign).

## Usage
To use the machine learning models for breast cancer prediction, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script for model training and prediction.

## Code Samples
Examples of how to train and use each machine learning model are provided in the [examples](examples/) directory.

## Data Preprocessing
Before training the models, the dataset underwent preprocessing steps to handle missing values and standardize features.

## Model Evaluation
The performance of each machine learning model was assessed using key metrics. Special considerations were made for challenges related to the breast cancer prediction task.
